# ✨ Summer 2025 — A Season of Growth

This summer, I’m embracing growth —  
refining my skills, diving deep into learning,  
and building with intention and heart.

A quote I heard recently stayed with me:  

> *دوام الحال من المحال*  
> *Nothing lasts forever*

It’s a reminder that change is certain,  
but so is new beginnings.  

_I won’t lose hope._  
_This is just the start of something beautiful._
